# MDIA1620 - Zinna (Seoyoung) Kim
>A *cool* repository for my **MDIA 1620 code**
---
## Aha moment:
1. When code, the folder name should not include any spaces 
2. 'file', 'folder' or 'desktop' and other names came from 1960s when they were using CARD system to code
3. Use of cd and dir in the terminals

## Still Unclear:
1. Github
2. Terminals

## How I'm feeling:
Excited to code
