# MDIA1620
>A *cool* repository for my **MDIA 1620 code**
---
## Aha moment:
1. When code, the folder name should not include any spaces 
2. Vocab of 'file', 'folder'or 'desktop' and other computer names came from 1960s when they were using CARD system to code
3. Recap on use of cd and dir in the terminals

## Still Unclear:
1. Use of github
2. n/a

## How I'm feeling:
Excited to code
